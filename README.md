## Overview

LLM Agents are the new tool in every cutting edge tech team toolbox.
Just like with Cloud applications, The new set of challanges with LLMs is enabling the organization to move fast, while not compormizing on customer data and security best practices.

The project is composed of:
* [Full-Stack Web-Application](./vibraniumdome-app/README.md) - For management & dashboard.
* [Shields Server](./vibraniumdome-shields/README.md) -  Receives LLM interactions via [Open Telemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) from the [vibraniumdome-sdk](https://github.com/genia-dev/vibraniumdome-sdk).
* [OpenSearch](./vibraniumdome-opensearch/README.md) - Provides storage & query analytics for LLM interactions received by the [Shields Server](./vibraniumdome-shields/README.md).


See [Getting Started](#getting-started) how to run all-in-one.

#### Vulnerabilities in focus

- Prompt Injections [LLM01](https://llmtop10.com/llm01/)
  - Direct - also known as "jailbreaking"
  - Indirect
- Insecure Output Handling [LLM02](https://llmtop10.com/llm02/)
- Model Denial of Service [LLM04](https://llmtop10.com/llm04/)
- Sensitive Information Disclosure [LLM06](https://llmtop10.com/llm06/)
- Insecure Plugin Design [LLM07](https://llmtop10.com/llm07/)
- Excessive Agency [LLM08](https://llmtop10.com/llm08/)

## Key features

VibraniumDome is a cutting edge innovative open source platform that empowers security teams in the LLM Agents era.

Full blown, end to end LLM WAF for Agents, allowing security teams govenrance, auditing, policy driven control over Agents usage of language models.
